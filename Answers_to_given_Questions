Q1: Why was it a good choice to divide the programm in exactly those functions that you implemented?
Q2: What was the most tricky part of the program and how did you find a good solution?
Q3: How much memory did your exe-file need? Can you give an example how you could have saved memory?

A1: I have dived the program in various functions so that the overall implementation in the main function will be minute. 
	Now it is easy to read and understad from the names of functions that what is happening. Hence, whenever I call a function
	the person reading the code instatntly gets the idea that at such a point what i the idea that is going to be implemented
	In addition, It also gives oppertunity to name the variables same every time as the scope of a variable in a function is 
	restricted to that particular function.
	
A2: The most tricky part was to implement the that how the computer detects user's marks and tries its bet win. 
	For this purpose, I have to implement functions that calls other functions. Furthermore, I have implemented
	the idea of linked lists that involves nested structs with pointers.

A3: The exe file requires 75KB to store in a computer. I tried to save memory by using pointers to save this memory.

My program is too simple that I am sure that it is executable on every IDE even on the online compilers.
